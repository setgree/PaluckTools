\title{Round Numbers to Arbitrary Accuracy with Directional Control}
\usage{
round_to(x, accuracy, direction = "default")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric value or vector to round.}

\item{accuracy}{The accuracy to round to (e.g., 5, 10, 0.1, etc.).}

\item{direction}{The direction to round: "default" for standard rounding,
"up" for ceiling, "down" for floor.}
}
\value{
A numeric value or vector rounded to the specified accuracy.
}
\description{
This utility function rounds numbers to a specified accuracy with
control over the rounding direction (up, down, or standard rounding).
It's particularly useful when you need to round to non-standard values
like the nearest 5, 10, 100, etc.
}
\examples{
# Round to nearest 5
round_to(23, 5)  # Returns 25

# Round down to nearest 100
round_to(847, 100, direction = "down")  # Returns 800

# Round up to nearest 10
round_to(23, 10, direction = "up")  # Returns 30

# Works with decimals too
round_to(3.14159, 0.01)  # Returns 3.14
