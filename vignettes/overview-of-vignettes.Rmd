## 1 BLPlabtools supports two research workflows.

BLPlabtools provides functions for two types of analysis:

1. **Meta-analysis**: Systematically combining results from multiple studies to estimate an overall effect.

2. **Experimental analysis**: Analyzing data from your own experiments, including running multiple regression specifications and creating publication-ready tables.

Which workflow you need depends on your research question. Meta-analysis combines results from *other people's studies*. Experimental analysis works with *your own data*.

## 2 Meta-analysis is (more or less) a six step process.

Meta-analysis is a systematic way to combine findings from multiple studies to estimate an overall effect. Here are the main steps:

1)  Identify a causal question where combining results from many papers will be informative.[^1]

2)  Decide which papers shed light on that question.[^2]

3)  Gather and read all such papers (i.e., conduct a systematic search).

4)  Condense each study's results to a single point estimate, or a cluster of point estimates, and associated variance(s).

5)  Aggregate those estimates into a pooled average effect and any relevant subgroup effects.

6)  Write up your results.

[^1]: For instance, you might want to assess the conditions (scope conditions) under which an effect can be expected; identify cross-study moderators that predict population- or setting-level effects that can strengthen or weaken effects; or compare multiple theoretical approaches to see which works best. The alternative to a meta-analysis for assessing the relationship between X and Y is to run a new experiment. But a meta-analysis can be very helpful in figuring out what that experiment should look like by illuminating gaps in the literature.

[^2]: In practice this means operationalizing X and Y, which might not be straightforward: does imagined contact count as contact? What exactly is prejudice, and how do we measure it? It also means setting inclusion criteria related to, e.g., internal validity, measurement error, or population. For instance, your meta-analysis might be focused only on the results of [policy-relevant randomized controlled trials](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/contact-hypothesis-reevaluated/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5), a [particular class of dependent variable](https://osf.io/a7g95/), or the effects of [sexual violence prevention programs on college campuses](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(23)00117-9/abstract).

**Vignettes 1-3 focus on steps 4-6 (the data analysis portion).**

Steps 1-3 involve literature review and study selection, which are covered extensively in other meta-analysis resources. These vignettes focus on the statistical analysis and writing stages.

The [first vignette](d-calc-vignette.html) is about **step 4**: calculating effect sizes and variance. It covers "easy" cases where you can use `d_calc` and `var_d_calc` without too much extra work, then walks through a few edge cases we've encountered over time. Finally, it demonstrates how to incorporate these functions into your analysis scripts in a reproducible way.

The [second vignette](meta-analysis-vignette.html) is about **step 5**, how to actually do meta-analysis. It covers using `map_robust` to combine your point estimates and variances into pooled estimates for the population and any subgroups you want to analyze.

The [third vignette](writing-metas-vignette.html) is about **step 6**, and walks through the other functions we've written to help write a meta-analysis paper. Specifically, it covers `summarise_lm`, `summarise_table`, and `study_count`, as well as a few smaller functions for turning a meta-analytic database into a bibliography and creating ggplot2-based visualizations.

**Vignette 4 covers experimental analysis and table formatting.**

If you're analyzing data from your own experiments (not conducting a meta-analysis), the [fourth vignette](experimental-analysis-vignette.html) demonstrates how to use `tidy_lm` for running multiple regression specifications efficiently, `robust_se` for cluster-robust standard errors, and various table formatting utilities for creating publication-ready LaTeX tables.
