## 1 What is PaluckTools?

PaluckTools provides functions and workflows for two main types of research in social psychology:

1. **Meta-analysis**: Systematically combining results from multiple studies
2. **Experimental analysis**: Analyzing data from your own experiments

This overview will help you navigate to the right vignettes for your needs.

## 2 Meta-analysis workflow (Vignettes 1-3)

Meta-analysis is a systematic way to combine findings from multiple studies to estimate an overall effect. It follows these steps:

1. Identify a causal question where combining results from many papers will be informative[^1]
2. Decide which papers shed light on that question[^2]
3. Gather and read all such papers (i.e., conduct a systematic search)
4. **Condense each study's results to a single point estimate (or cluster of estimates) and associated variance(s)**
5. **Aggregate those estimates into a pooled average effect and any relevant subgroup effects**
6. **Write up your results**

[^1]: For instance, you might want to assess the conditions (scope conditions) under which an effect can be expected; identify cross-study moderators that predict population- or setting-level effects; or compare multiple theoretical approaches. The alternative to a meta-analysis for assessing the relationship between X and Y is to run a new experiment. But a meta-analysis can help figure out what that experiment should look like by illuminating gaps in the literature.

[^2]: In practice this means operationalizing X and Y, which might not be straightforward: does imagined contact count as contact? What exactly is prejudice, and how do we measure it? It also means setting inclusion criteria related to internal validity, measurement error, or population. For instance, your meta-analysis might focus only on [policy-relevant randomized controlled trials](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/contact-hypothesis-reevaluated/142C913E7FA9E121277B29E994124EC5), a [particular class of dependent variable](https://osf.io/a7g95/), or the effects of [sexual violence prevention programs on college campuses](https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(23)00117-9/abstract).

### Vignettes for meta-analysis:

Steps 1-3 involve literature review and study selection, covered in other resources. **The meta-analysis vignettes focus on steps 4-6** (the statistical analysis and writing stages):

- **[Vignette 1: Calculating effect sizes](d-calc-vignette.html)** - How to convert study results into standardized effect sizes and variances using `d_calc`, `var_d_calc`, and helper functions

- **[Vignette 2: Running meta-analyses](meta-analysis-vignette.html)** - How to aggregate effect sizes across studies using `map_robust`

- **[Vignette 3: Writing your paper](writing-metas-vignette.html)** - Helper functions for creating tables, figures, bibliographies, and reproducible research environments

## 3 Experimental analysis workflow (Vignette 4)

If you're analyzing data from your own experiments (not conducting a meta-analysis), you'll want different tools:

- **[Vignette 4: Experimental analysis and tables](experimental-analysis-vignette.html)** - Covers `tidy_lm` for running multiple regression specifications, `robust_se` for cluster-robust standard errors, and table formatting utilities for creating publication-ready LaTeX tables

This vignette demonstrates how to:
- Run many regression models efficiently
- Handle clustered standard errors
- Prepare output for stargazer tables
- Format tables for publication

## 4 Getting started

**Conducting a meta-analysis?** → Start with [Vignette 1: Calculating effect sizes](d-calc-vignette.html)

**Analyzing experimental data?** → Jump to [Vignette 4: Experimental analysis](experimental-analysis-vignette.html)

**Not sure?** → Meta-analysis combines results from *other people's studies*. Experimental analysis works with *your own data*. If you're still unsure, start with Vignette 1 to get a sense of what meta-analysis involves.
